Step 1: Collect a dataset of videos
To train your deep learning model, you'll need a dataset of videos that show proper and improper form. You can start by collecting videos of professional lifters performing Olympic lifts from YouTube, Instagram, or other sources. Make sure to collect a diverse range of videos that show different angles, weights, and techniques.

Estimated time: 2-3 hours

Step 2: Extract key frames and annotate the dataset
Using a tool like OpenCV, extract key frames from each video in your dataset. You can then annotate each frame with the correct pose and label (e.g., proper or improper form). This will help your deep learning model learn to recognize and classify different poses.

Estimated time: 4-5 hours

Step 3: Train a pose detection model
Using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, train a pose detection model on your annotated dataset. This model will learn to recognize and classify different poses in your videos. You can start with an existing pre-trained model and fine-tune it for your specific task.

Estimated time: 10-12 hours

Step 4: Integrate the model into a mobile app
Using a mobile app development framework like React Native or Flutter, create an app that can take video input from your phone's camera or from a pre-recorded video. You'll need to integrate your pose detection model into the app and provide real-time feedback on form.

Estimated time: 20-30 hours

Step 5: Test and refine the app
Once you have a working prototype, test it with a small group of users and collect feedback. Use this feedback to refine the app and improve its accuracy and performance.
